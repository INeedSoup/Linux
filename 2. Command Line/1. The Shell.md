### What the Shell Is

The shell is a program that takes the commands you type and sends them to the operating system to execute.  
Tools like **Terminal**, **Console**, or **xterm** are just applications that open a shell session for you.  
It’s the main interface you’ll use when working with Linux through text commands.

## Bash (Bourne Again Shell)

Most Linux systems use **Bash** as the default shell.  
It’s reliable, widely used, and a great starting point before exploring other shells like `zsh`, `ksh`, or `tcsh`.

---

## The Shell Prompt

When you open a terminal, you’ll see a prompt that’s usually in this format:

```
username@hostname:current_directory$
```

Example:

```
pete@icebox:/home/pete $
```

The `$` tells you the shell is ready for your input.  
You don’t type this symbol; it’s just part of the prompt.

---

## Your First Command: echo

The `echo` command prints whatever text you provide.

Example:

```
echo Hello World
```

Output:

```
Hello World
```

It’s simple, but it helps you understand how commands work and how the shell displays results.
