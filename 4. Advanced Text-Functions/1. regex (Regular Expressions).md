Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to search, match, and manipulate text. They are essential for working efficiently on the Linux command line and are widely supported across tools like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and many programming languages.

Regex patterns are different from shell wildcards. Wildcards like `*` work at the file-system level, while regex works inside text.

Below are the core regex elements and how they work, using this sample text:

```
sally sells seashells
by the seashore
```

---

## **1. Anchors**

### **Start of Line: `^`**

Matches only when the pattern appears at the beginning of a line.

Example:

```
^by
```

Matches:  
`by the seashore`  
Does not match:  
`sally sells seashells`

### **End of Line: `$`**

Matches only when the pattern appears at the end of a line.

Example:

```
seashore$
```

Matches the line ending with `seashore`.

**Note:** Anchors match positions, not characters.

---

## **2. Matching Any Single Character: `.`**

The dot matches any single character except a newline.

Example:

```
b.
```

Matches `by` in the second line.

**Tip:** Combine multiple dots to match unknown lengths, for example:  
`...` matches any three characters.

---

## **3. Character Sets: `[]`**

Brackets match any one character from the set.

Example:

```
s[ae]lls
```

Matches `sells` and would match `salls` if it existed.

### **Negated Character Sets: `[^ ]`**

When a caret is the first character **inside** the brackets, it negates the set.

Example:

```
s[^e]lls
```

Matches `salls` but not `sells`.

### **Ranges inside Sets**

Ranges let you specify sequential characters.

Example:

```
d[a-c]g
```

Matches `dag`, `dbg`, `dcg`.

Ranges are case-sensitive, so `[a-c]` differs from `[A-C]`.

---

## **4. Additional Useful Basics**
### **Zero or More: `*`**

Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.

Example:

```
se*
```

Matches `s`, `se`, `see`, etc.

### **One or More: `+`**

Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.

Example:

```
s+e
```

Matches sequences like `se` or `ssse`.

### **Zero or One: `?`**

Makes the preceding character optional.

Example:

```
colou?r
```

Matches both `color` and `colour`.

### **Grouping: `()`**

Parentheses group parts of a pattern.

Example:

```
(Sea)?shore
```

Matches `seashore` and `shore`.

### **Alternation: `|`**

Acts like a logical OR.

Example:

```
sea|shore
```

Matches either `sea` or `shore`.

## **5. Where Regex Is Used in Linux**

Common command-line tools that rely on regex:

- **grep** for searching text  
    `grep "^s" file.txt`
- **sed** for stream editing  
    `sed 's/sell/buy/' file.txt`
- **awk** for pattern scanning  
    `awk '/shore$/ {print}' file.txt`    

Understanding regex greatly speeds up text processing in Linux.
