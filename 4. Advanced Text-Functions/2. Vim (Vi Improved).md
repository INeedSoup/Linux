Vim is a fast, lightweight, and highly configurable text editor that builds on the original Vi. It is available on nearly all Unix-like systems, which makes it a critical tool for developers, sysadmins, and anyone working on remote servers.

## **1. What Vim Is**

Vim stands for **Vi Improved**. It expands on the classic Vi editor by adding:

- Syntax highlighting    
- Multi-level undo and redo    
- Extensive built-in help    
- Plugin support    
- Multiple editing modes    
- Macros, registers, and custom key mappings    

The core idea behind Vim is efficiency. Most actions happen without leaving the keyboard.

## **2. Why Use Vim**

- It is installed by default on almost every Linux system.    
- It launches quickly and handles large files well.    
- It works the same on Linux, macOS, and Windows.    
- It allows fast text editing once you learn the basics.    

For anyone working with servers or code, knowing basic Vim is an essential skill.

## **3. Starting Vim**

Open Vim with:

```
vim
```

Open a specific file:

```
vim filename.txt
```

If the file doesn’t exist, Vim will create it the moment you save.

# **4. Vim Search Patterns**

Searching is a core part of navigating files efficiently.

### **Forward Search**

Use `/` followed by a pattern.

```
/pretty
```

This jumps to the next match after the cursor.

### **Backward Search**

Use `?` followed by a pattern.

```
?pretty
```

This finds matches before the cursor.

### **Move Between Matches**

- `n` goes to the next match in the same direction.    
- `N` goes to the previous match.    

Search works with regex-style patterns, so you can look for words, phrases, or complex expressions.

# **5. Vim Navigation**

Vim uses keyboard-based movement:

- `h` moves left    
- `j` moves down    
- `k` moves up    
- `l` moves right    

Arrow keys work too, but the `hjkl` keys are faster once you get used to them.

Additional helpful motions (added):

- `w` jumps forward to the start of the next word    
- `b` jumps back to the start of the previous word    
- `0` moves to the beginning of the line    
- `$` moves to the end of the line    
- `gg` goes to the top of the file    
- `G` goes to the bottom of the file

# **6. Inserting and Appending Text**

Vim has two primary modes:

- **Normal mode** for commands    
- **Insert mode** for typing    

Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode anytime.

### **Insert Commands**

- `i` inserts text before the cursor    
- `I` inserts at the start of the line    

### **Append Commands**

- `a` appends after the cursor    
- `A` appends at the end of the line    

**Difference (important):**  
Insert puts the cursor _before_ the text you will add, append puts it _after_.

### **Adding New Lines**

- `o` opens a new line below    
- `O` opens a new line above    

Counts work here too:

```
3o
```

Creates three blank lines below the current one.

# **7. Editing Text in Vim**

Vim’s editing system follows the pattern:

```
operator + motion
```

Example:  
`dw` deletes to the start of the next word.

### **Deleting**

- `x` deletes one character    
- `dw` deletes to the next word    
- `d$` deletes to the end of the line    
- `dd` deletes the entire line    
- `3dd` deletes three lines    

### **Changing Text**

The change operator deletes and then places you into Insert mode.

- `cw` changes a word    
- `c$` changes to end of line    
- `cc` changes the entire line    

### **Copy and Paste**

- `yw` yanks a word    
- `yy` yanks a line    
- `p` pastes after the cursor    
- `P` pastes before the cursor    

### **Other Useful Editing Tools**

- `rX` replaces one character with `X`    
- `R` enters overwrite mode    
- `J` joins the line below to the current line    
- `.` repeats your last change    

These commands become extremely powerful when combined with motions like `}` (next paragraph), `aw` (a word), or counts.

# **8. Saving and Exiting**

Use command-line mode by pressing `:`.

### **Saving**

- `:w` writes changes to disk    

### **Quit Options**

- `:q` quits if no changes were made    
- `:q!` quits and discards unsaved changes    

### **Save and Quit**

- `:wq` writes and quits    
- `ZZ` does the same thing and is faster to type    

### **Undo and Redo**

- `u` undoes the last change    
- `Ctrl-r` redoes an undone change
