Some tasks require regular users to temporarily gain elevated privileges. Instead of giving users full root access, Linux offers special permission bits that allow specific programs to run with the permissions of their owner. One of the most important of these is the **Set User ID** bit, or **SUID**.

SUID allows a program to run **with the privileges of the file’s owner**, not the user who launched it.

## **1. Why SUID Exists**

Many administrative programs need root-level access to perform actions. For example, the `passwd` command must update `/etc/shadow`, a file only root can write to.

Yet any user should be able to change their own password.

### `/etc/shadow` permissions:

```
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow ...
```

Only root can write to it.

### But `passwd` works for regular users because of SUID:

```
ls -l /usr/bin/passwd

-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47032 ...
```

Notice the **s** in the user permission area (`rws`). This indicates SUID is set.

When a user runs `passwd`, it executes **with root’s permissions**, allowing it to modify `/etc/shadow`.

Without SUID, users would not be able to change their passwords.

## **2. How SUID Appears in Permission Strings**

In the **owner’s execute position**, instead of `x`, you might see:

- `s` → SUID + executable (normal case)    
- `S` → SUID set _but_ the file is **not executable**    

Example with SUID active:

```
rwsr-xr-x
```

Example with SUID but no execute:

```
rwSr-xr-x
```

The capital letter signals a misconfiguration, because SUID has no effect without execute permission.

## **3. Setting SUID**

You can modify SUID the same way you change normal permissions.

### **Symbolic mode**

Enable SUID:

```
sudo chmod u+s myfile
```

Remove SUID:

```
sudo chmod u-s myfile
```

### **Numerical (octal) mode**

SUID is represented by **4** in the leading position:

```
sudo chmod 4755 myfile
```

Breakdown:

- `4` → enable SUID    
- `755` → normal permission bits    

To remove it:

```
sudo chmod 0755 myfile
```

## **4. Security Considerations** _(Added)_

SUID programs must be handled carefully because:

- If compromised, they can grant root access.    
- Bugs in SUID binaries can lead to privilege escalation.    
- Only trusted system tools should use SUID.    

Common safe SUID programs include:

- `/usr/bin/passwd`    
- `/bin/su`    
- `/usr/bin/chsh`    

Administrators should avoid setting SUID on custom scripts or unknown binaries.
