Linux file permissions can be changed using the `chmod` command. This is one of the most important skills for managing access to files and directories. You can modify permissions with either **symbolic mode** or **numerical (octal) mode**.

## **1. Changing Permissions with Symbolic Mode**

Symbolic mode uses letters to indicate _who_ the change applies to and _what_ permission is being added or removed.

### **Targets**

- `u` — user (owner)    
- `g` — group    
- `o` — others    
- `a` — all (user, group, and others simultaneously)    

### **Operators**

- `+` add a permission    
- `-` remove a permission    
- `=` set exact permissions, replacing any existing ones (added for completeness)    

### **Examples**

Add execute permission for the owner:

```
chmod u+x myfile
```

Remove write permission from the group:

```
chmod g-w myfile
```

Give user and group write permissions in a single command:

```
chmod ug+w myfile
```

Set precise permissions using `=`:

```
chmod u=rw,g=r,o= myfile
```

Symbolic mode is easy to read and is often preferred when adjusting a few permissions at a time.

## **2. Changing Permissions with Numerical (Octal) Mode**

Numerical mode sets all three permission groups at once using a three-digit number. Each permission has a numeric value:

- read = **4**    
- write = **2**    
- execute = **1**    

You add them together to form the permission value.

### **Common Example**

```
chmod 755 myfile
```

Breakdown:

- `7` (user): 4 + 2 + 1 = **rwx**    
- `5` (group): 4 + 0 + 1 = **r-x**    
- `5` (others): 4 + 0 + 1 = **r-x**    

Other common values:

- `644` → user can read & write; group/others read only    
- `600` → private file for the owner    
- `700` → private executable directory or script    

Numerical mode is faster and preferred in scripting or administrative work.

## **3. Security Considerations**

Changing permissions impacts system security, so use `chmod` thoughtfully.

### **Best practices**

- Avoid granting more permissions than necessary (principle of least privilege).    
- Be cautious with directories, where `w` and `x` behave differently.    
- Never blindly run:    

```
chmod -R 777 /some/directory
```

This gives everyone full read, write, and execute permissions, which can expose sensitive files or allow unauthorized code execution.

### **Added note:**

Users sometimes combine symbolic and recursion:

```
chmod -R g+w project/
```

Use recursive changes only when you fully understand the effect on every file and directory inside.
