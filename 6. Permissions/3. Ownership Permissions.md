Every file and directory on a Linux system has two ownership attributes:

- **User (owner)**    
- **Group**    

These ownership properties determine who can read, modify, or execute a file when combined with standard permission bits. Managing ownership is essential for controlling access in multi-user environments.

## **1. Changing User Ownership**

To change the user who owns a file, use the `chown` command:

```
sudo chown patty myfile
```

This sets the owner of `myfile` to **patty**.

Key points:

- Only root (or a user with sudo permissions) can change file ownership.    
- This command does not modify group ownership unless you specify it.

## **2. Changing Group Ownership**

To change the group associated with a file, use the `chgrp` command:

```
sudo chgrp whales myfile
```

This assigns the file to the **whales** group. Any user in that group will receive group-level permissions applied to the file.

Note:  
Users can change the group of a file _only_ if they belong to that group.

---

## **3. Changing Both User and Group Ownership Together**

`chown` can modify both owner and group in one command by using a colon:

```
sudo chown patty:whales myfile
```

This is the most common and efficient way to update ownership.

Format:

```
chown user:group filename
```

### Additional variations:

- Change only the group (using a leading colon):
```
sudo chown :whales myfile
```
- Change only the user:
```
sudo chown patty myfile
```

---

## **4. Recursively Changing Ownership**

For directories, you can update ownership of the directory _and_ everything inside it:

```
sudo chown -R patty:whales project/
```

Use this with care, as it affects all nested files and subdirectories.

## **5. How Ownership Works with Permissions**

Ownership ties directly into the three permission sets:

- **User (owner)** uses the first permission group    
- **Group** uses the second    
- **Other** uses the last    

Changing ownership alters which users or groups benefit from the existing permission bits
