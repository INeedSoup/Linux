Beyond standard read, write, and execute permissions, Linux includes special permission bits that control advanced behavior. The third and final special permission bit is the **sticky bit**, which is used primarily to protect files in shared directories.

---

## **1. What the Sticky Bit Does**

The sticky bit restricts file deletion and renaming inside a directory.

When the sticky bit is set on a directory:

- Users **can create files** in the directory    
- Users **cannot delete or rename someone else’s files**    
- Only the **file’s owner**, the **directory’s owner**, or **root** can delete or move a file    

This is essential in shared environments where multiple users have write access to the same directory.

---

## **2. Common Example: The `/tmp` Directory**

`/tmp` is a world-writable directory used for temporary files. Without extra protection, one user could delete another user’s files. The sticky bit prevents that.

Check the permissions:

```
ls -ld /tmp
```

You’ll see something like:

```
drwxrwxrwt 17 root root 4096 Dec 15 11:45 /tmp
```

Focus on the final `t`:

```
rwxrwxrw**t**
```

This shows the sticky bit is enabled.

Even though everyone can write to `/tmp`, they **cannot** delete files they don’t own.

---

## **3. How to Set the Sticky Bit**

You can set the sticky bit using either symbolic mode or octal mode.

### **Symbolic Mode**

Add the sticky bit:

```
chmod +t my_shared_dir
```

Remove it:

```
chmod -t my_shared_dir
```

### **Octal Mode**

The sticky bit is represented by **1** in the leading octal digit:

```
chmod 1755 my_shared_dir
```

Breakdown:

- `1` → enable sticky bit    
- `755` → regular permissions    

This results in:

```
rwxr-xr-t
```

### **How to identify the sticky bit**

- `t` → sticky bit + execute permission set    
- `T` → sticky bit set _but no execute permission_ (uncommon and usually a misconfiguration)

## **4. When the Sticky Bit Is Useful** _(Added)_

The sticky bit is commonly used for:

- Shared project directories    
- Public upload folders    
- Temporary storage directories    
- Multi-user systems where collaboration occurs    

It ensures shared writable directories do not become a security hazard.
