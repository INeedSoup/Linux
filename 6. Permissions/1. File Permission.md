Linux treats nearly everything as a file, and controlling access to these files is essential for system security. File permissions determine who can read, modify, or execute a given file or directory.

## **1. Viewing File Permissions**

Use long-format listing to view permission details:

```
ls -l Desktop/
```

Example output:

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 pete penguins 4096 Dec 1 11:45 .
```

We focus on the first column:

```
drwxr-xr-x
```

This string shows the file type and permissions.

## **2. Breaking Down the Permission String**

The permission string has **four parts**:

```
d | rwx | r-x | r-x
```

### **1. File Type (first character)**

- `d` → directory    
- `-` → regular file    
- `l` → symbolic link    
- `c` → character device    
- `b` → block device    
- others exist, but these are the common ones    

### **2–10. Permission Bits**

The remaining nine characters come in three groups:

- **User (owner)**    
- **Group**    
- **Other (everyone else)**    

Each group uses the same three-character pattern:

- `r` → read    
- `w` → write    
- `x` → execute
    - `-` → permission not granted

Example:

```
rwx    r-x    r-x
user   group  other
```

## **3. What the Permissions Mean**

### **For regular files**

- **read (r)**: view file contents    
- **write (w)**: modify or delete file    
- **execute (x)**: run as a program or script    

### **For directories**

These behave differently:

- **read (r)**: list directory contents    
- **write (w)**: create, delete, or rename files in the directory    
- **execute (x)**: “enter” or access the directory (required to traverse it)    

A directory usually needs both **r** and **x** for meaningful access.

---

## **4. User, Group, and Other**

Using the example:

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 pete penguins ...
```

- **User (owner): `rwx`**  
    The owner `pete` can read, write, and execute.    
- **Group: `r-x`**  
    Members of the `penguins` group can read and execute but not write.    
- **Other: `r-x`**  
    Every other user on the system has the same read and execute permissions.    

This structure allows Linux to finely control who can modify or access files.
