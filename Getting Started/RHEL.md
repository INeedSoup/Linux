Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it is a leading choice for an enterprise Linux OS, built to provide long-term stability, security, and professional support. While RHEL requires a subscription for use in production, RH provides its source code freely

# Package Management
RHEL uses the RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) format for its software packages. For managing these packages, it provides YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) and its successor, DNF (Dandified YUM)

The primary appeal of RHEL lies in its suitability for enterprise Linux systems. It is designed for mission-critical workloads, offering a predictable release cycle, long-term support (up to 10 years or more), and a vast ecosystem of certified hardware and software.

Fedora serves as the upstream, community-driven project where new features are developed and tested. These innovations are then refined and stabilised for inclusion in future version of RHEL, CentOS Stream now serves as the development branch for upcoming RHEL release.

Red Hat offers a well-respected **certification redhat** program. Key certifications include the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) and Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE). These credentials are highly valued by employers and demonstrate a high level of expertise in managing RHEL environments.
