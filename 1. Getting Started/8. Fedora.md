Sponsored by Red Hat, the Fedora project is a community driven initiative that develops and maintains a free and open source OS.

A crucial aspect of Fedora is its role as the upstream source for **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** (RHEL). This means new features, updates, and innovations are developed and tested within the Fedora community first. After a thorough process of testing and quality assurance, these stable features are incorporated into future versions of RHEL.

Fedora utilises the RPM package format and manages software with the DNF (Dandified YUM) package manager.

Fedora is an excellent choice for users who want a Red Hat-based operating system without the enterprise cost.
