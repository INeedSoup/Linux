**• Gentoo is a source-based Linux distribution** that compiles software directly on the user’s machine for maximum customization.
**• It’s aimed at users who want full control and don’t mind a complex, hands-on setup.**
**• Portage is Gentoo’s package manager.**  
It downloads source code, compiles it, and uses **USE flags** to enable or disable features for each package.
**• USE flags let you fine-tune software**, removing unneeded features and dependencies so the system stays efficient and lightweight.
**• The source-based approach allows strong optimization** for specific hardware and use cases.
**• Installation and maintenance are time-consuming**, since much of the system must be built manually.
**• Gentoo suits desktops, laptops, and servers** where performance and customization are key.
