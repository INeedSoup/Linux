Linux is designed as a multi-user operating system. Every file, process, and system action is tied to a specific user or group. Understanding how users and groups work is central to managing permissions and securing a system.

## **1. What Users and Groups Are**

### **Users**

A user account represents a person or a service running on the system. Each user has:

- A **username**  
- A **home directory**, usually `/home/username`    
- A **User ID (UID)**    
- A default group (primary group)    

While humans identify accounts by their username, Linux relies on **UIDs**, which are unique numbers.

### **Groups**

A group is a collection of users. Groups make it easier to manage permissions for many users at once.

- Each group has a **Group ID (GID)**.    
- A user can be in multiple groups.    
- Group membership affects what files or folders the user can access.    

**Added note:**  
System services (like `daemon`, `www-data`, `nobody`) are also represented as users and groups.

## **2. The Superuser (root)**

The **root** account is the superuser. It can:

- Access any file    
- Start or stop any process    
- Install or remove software    
- Modify system configuration    

Root has **UID 0**, which the system checks before allowing privileged actions.

Working as root full-time is dangerous. Mistakes can break the system or delete important files.

## **3. Using `sudo`**

`sudo` lets authorized users run commands with root privileges temporarily.

Example:

```
sudo apt update
```

Only users listed in the **sudoers** configuration (typically members of the `sudo` or `wheel` group) can use it.

**Important additions:**

- The sudo configuration is stored in `/etc/sudoers`.    
- You should edit it with `visudo` to avoid breaking permissions.

## **4. Viewing a Restricted File Example**

Try reading `/etc/shadow`, which contains encrypted password hashes:

```
cat /etc/shadow
```

This fails with:

```
Permission denied
```

Check the file’s permissions:

```
ls -la /etc/shadow
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1134 Dec 1 11:45 /etc/shadow
```

This means:

- Owner: **root**    
- Group: **shadow**    
- Only root or shadow group members can read it.    

Now use `sudo`:

```
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```

You’ll be prompted for your password. If authorized, the command runs with elevated privileges.

## **5. Where User and Group Information Lives**

Linux stores user and group data in standard files:

- `/etc/passwd` — basic user information    
- `/etc/shadow` — encrypted passwords    
- `/etc/group` — group membership    

These are read by commands like `id`, `groups`, and authentication tools.

## **6. Useful Commands for Working with Users and Groups**

- `id username` — show UID, GID, and group memberships    
- `groups username` — show groups user is in    
- `who` — show who is logged in    
- `sudo -l` — show allowed sudo commands
