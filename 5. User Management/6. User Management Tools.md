Linux provides several command-line utilities for creating, modifying, and removing user accounts. Understanding these tools is essential for managing standalone systems and is also foundational knowledge before working with enterprise identity systems.

The main tools include:

- `useradd`    
- `userdel`    
- `usermod`    
- `passwd`    

These utilities edit system files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/etc/group` safely and consistently.

## **1. Adding Users**

The primary tool for creating new accounts is:

```
sudo useradd bob
```

`useradd`:

- Creates a user entry in `/etc/passwd`    
- Creates a corresponding entry in `/etc/shadow`    
- Sets up a home directory (depending on system defaults)    
- Assigns the user a primary group    
- Applies defaults from `/etc/default/useradd` and `/etc/login.defs`    

### **About `adduser`**

Many distributions provide `adduser`, which is a friendlier, interactive script that asks for details like:

- Full name    
- Phone number    
- Password    

But `useradd` is the standard low-level tool available across all systems.

### **Verify account creation** (added):

```
id bob
```

This shows the user’s UID, GID, and groups.

## **2. Removing Users**

To delete a user account:

```
sudo userdel bob
```

This removes the user from system databases but does **not** delete their home directory by default.

To remove the home directory and mail spool:

```
sudo userdel -r bob
```

This is useful when fully retiring a user account from a system.

## **3. Changing User Passwords**

The `passwd` command sets or modifies a user’s password.

### **User changes their own password:**

```
passwd
```

### **Administrator changes another user’s password:**

```
sudo passwd bob
```

An administrator does _not_ need to provide the old password; they only enter the new one.

### **Password management capabilities** (added):

- Lock an account:
```
sudo passwd -l bob
```
- Unlock an account:
```
sudo passwd -u bob
```
- Expire a password immediately (forces reset at next login):
```
sudo passwd -e bob
```

These commands tie directly into `/etc/shadow` and its password aging fields.

## **4. Modifying Existing Users** _(Important addition)_

While `useradd` and `userdel` handle creating and removing users, `usermod` is the tool used for editing account settings.

Examples:

### **Change the login name:**

```
sudo usermod -l newname bob
```

### **Add a user to an additional group:**

```
sudo usermod -aG wheel bob
```

### **Change the user's home directory:**

```
sudo usermod -d /new/home bob
```

### **Change the default shell:**

```
sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh bob
```

`usermod` updates all related files safely and ensures consistency across the system.

## **5. Files Updated by User Management Tools**

These commands modify key authentication files:

- `/etc/passwd` — basic user info    
- `/etc/shadow` — password hashes and aging    
- `/etc/group` — secondary group membership    
- `/etc/gshadow` — group password data    
- `/home/username` — created or removed depending on flags    

Because manual edits can break authentication, using these tools is strongly recommended
