Linux reserves a special account called **root** for tasks that require full administrative control. This account has unrestricted privileges, including the ability to modify system files, manage hardware, and change access permissions. Because of its power, access to root must be handled carefully.

---

## **1. The Root User in Linux**

The root user:

- Has **UID 0**, which the system checks to grant full privileges.    
- Bypasses normal permission checks.    
- Can read, write, or delete any file.    
- Can start, stop, or modify any process.    

Directly logging into root is possible, but it is rarely recommended. Most distributions disable direct root login over SSH for security reasons.

## **2. The `su` Command**

`su` stands for **substitute user**. It allows you to switch to another user account.

### **Become root:**

```
su
```

This opens a shell as the root user, after prompting for the root password.

### **Switch to another user:**

```
su username
```

This starts a new shell with that user’s privileges.

### **Why `su` can be risky**

Opening a persistent root shell:

- Increases the chance of a harmful command being executed by mistake.    
- Makes changes difficult to audit because actions appear to be done by “root,” not your personal account.    
- Removes the need for authentication per command, which reduces accountability.    

Because of these risks, many administrators prefer using `sudo` for one-off administrative tasks.

## **3. Why `sudo` Is Safer**

`sudo` executes a single command with elevated privileges. It:

- Logs every command you run with timestamp and username.    
- Requires your own password instead of the root password.    
- Reduces the time you spend with full privileges.    
- Prevents unauthorized users from running dangerous commands.    

Many Linux systems are configured so everyday users cannot access the root password, intentionally pushing them toward `sudo`.

---

## **4. The sudoers File**

Access to `sudo` is controlled by:

```
/etc/sudoers
```

This file defines:

- Which users can run `sudo`.    
- Which commands they are allowed to run.    
- Whether they need a password.    
- Whether they can run commands as root or another user.    

### **Editing sudoers safely**

Never open `/etc/sudoers` directly with a normal editor. Use:

```
visudo
```

`visudo` provides:

- Syntax checking    
- Locking to prevent multiple edits    
- A safe fallback if you introduce errors    

This prevents misconfigurations that could block all users, including root, from using `sudo`.

### **Related paths and files (added for completeness):**

- `/etc/sudoers.d/` — Directory for drop-in config files    
- `wheel` or `sudo` groups — Common groups used to grant sudo access    

Example of a typical sudoers entry:

```
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

This allows all users in the `sudo` group to run any command as root.
